This project implements a simple financial transaction system using C socket programming, where a client interacts with a server to perform basic banking operations. The server acts as a bank, maintaining an account balance and processing client requests such as checking the balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing money. The client connects to the server using TCP sockets, ensuring reliable and ordered message delivery. When a user enters a command, the client sends it to the server, which interprets it, updates the account data if necessary, and sends back a response. The server listens for incoming connections, accepts a client, and continuously exchanges data until the client requests termination. Both server and client use standard socket APIs like socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), send(), and recv() to handle network communication.
The system is a client-server application where; the server acts as a bank that holds and manages an account balance and the client represents a user performing financial transactions such as checking balance, depositing, or withdrawing money.
